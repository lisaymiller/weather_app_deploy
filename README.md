# Welcome

This is a React project I built using this tutorial: `https://youtu.be/GuA0_Z1llYU`

## How to use

The basis of the application is that you put in a city name, and you get the weather back! Run using `npm start`, and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application!

## Deployment

This app is also deployed at `https://lisaymiller.github.io/weather_app_deploy/`
